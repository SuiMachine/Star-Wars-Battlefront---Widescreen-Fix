# Star Wars: Battlefront
Wrapper for Star Wars: Battlefront that fixes camera aspect ratio, based on idea by ivanproff.

Current version of a fix uses ThirteenAG's [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader).

This fix is now archived, as after a year Disney (and possibly guys from GOG) fixed their garbage and it's now nice and shiny.
